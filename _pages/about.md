I am Sruthi Suresh, an astrophysicist with a fondness for active galaxies and large datasets. I completed my Master’s degree in Astrophysics at Pondicherry University, where my thesis focused on simulating the dusty torus of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using the radiative transfer code SKIRT. I’m a third-year PhD student at the University of Melbourne, Australia. I primarily work on optical studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN), exploring their physical properties and their connection to host galaxies through large spectroscopic datasets. Before fully committing to research, I worked for a year as a space educator, gaining hands-on experience with telescopes and astrophotography—proof that I have, at least occasionally, looked through an eyepiece rather than just at plots.
